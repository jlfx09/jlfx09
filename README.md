### Hi there, I am jlfx09 if you're curious regarding my username, it is derived from characters that I like in games ^^ ðŸ‘‹

To help with getting to know me better here are some information regarding myself:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a bit of C++ or Python (Right now practicing Tailwind alongside HTML)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on so far, still looking.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with programming languages that are useful for future careers.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anime, games and things that I generally know
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Facebook, Discord or Personally.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I typically like playing Gacha Games, other than that I am interested in programming languages that could be used in game development.
