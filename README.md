### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**jlfx09/jlfx09** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my programming skills.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a bit of C++ or Python (still looking into which is better.)
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on so far, still looking.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with programming languages that are useful for future careers.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anime, games and things that I generally know
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Facebook, Discord or Personally.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I typically like playing Gacha Games, other than that I am interested in programming languages that could be used in game development.
